# BIG-DATA-ANALYSIS
#Objective:
Perform analysis on a large dataset to demonstrate scalability using Dask for big data processing.
🛠️Tools & Technologies Used:
Python
Dask (Parallel Computing for DataFrames)
Matplotlib (Visualization)
Dataset: yellow_tripdata_2019-01.csv
🔍 Task Overview:
1.Processed a large New York Taxi dataset (yellow_tripdata_2019-01.csv) with Dask.
2.Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on payment types to gain insights from millions of records.
3.Utilized Dask to handle data that is too large for traditional pandas workflows.
📈 Key Insights Derived:
1.Distribution of payment types used by passengers.
2.Demonstrated Dask's ability to scale beyond memory limits.
3.Visualized insights using bar charts.
